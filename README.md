# RECNO Project

This is database that allows fast access to records via an integer record number,
intended to be an improvement over Berkeley DB or LMDB using BTREE.

This is a refactor of (recnodb)[https://www.github.com/cjungmann/recnodb.git],
hopefully avoiding coding dead ends encountered in that project.
